The first thing you need to mint pocket tees on Aloud is an Ethereum wallet. This is a app or browser plugin that let's you run decentalized apps or dApps, like Aloud.

We recommend using Meta Mask for your Ethereum Wallet. You can use any other browser-based Ethereum wallet you prefer. Coinbase has one as well. 

This allows you to do three things:
1. Log in to our website
2. Mint a tee shirt with Ethereum
3. Manage your Minted Tees

We'll walk you through how to set up a wallet, and load it with Ethereum 

1. Go to Metamask.com and download the browser plugin or phone app
2. Purchase Ethereum through an exhange or through the wallet itself. 
3. Make sure your wallet has enough Ethereum to complete the transaction
