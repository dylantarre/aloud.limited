Each time an Aloud Pocket Tee is sold on [Aloud.Shop](http://aloud.shop) the owner of the matching NFT is rewarded with a **25% commission** on the sale. 

The price of an Aloud Pocket Tee is **$34.99** USD.

So the NFT owner is awarded the equivalent of **$8.75** for each sale.

Shortly after a purchase the NFT holder will recieve funds to their Ethereum wallet address.
